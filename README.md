## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
-   A Google Cloud Platform project with the **YouTube Data API v3** enabled.
-   A Google Gemini API Key.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  **Install NPM packages**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Set up environment variables**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add the following variables:
    ```env
    # Google OAuth Credentials from your Google Cloud Project
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
    GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback"

    # Get this from Google AI Studio
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```
5.  **Run the development server**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
6.  **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:3000`. The first time you run the app, you will need to click "Authenticate with Google" to grant access and generate the refresh token.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment on Vercel

This project is optimized for deployment on Vercel.

1.  **Push your code** to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.
2.  **Import the project** on Vercel.
3.  **Add your Environment Variables** in the Vercel project settings. You will need all the variables from your `.env.local` file.
4.  **Update Google Cloud Credentials**: In your Google Cloud Console, add your Vercel app's URL to the "Authorized redirect URIs". It will look like `https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api/auth/callback`.

For a production environment on Vercel, it is recommended to store the `refresh_token` as an environment variable instead of using the file-based method.
